## 📦 Installation
Install the plug-in from the **Micro.blog plug-in directory** or upload this repository as a custom plug-in. After installation, open the plug-in settings to configure it.

## 📝 Usage
Assign the plug-in to your site and visit `/photos` (or your custom photos URL).  
If you specify a photos category, only posts in that category are displayed; otherwise, every post image is considered.

## ⚙️ Plugin Settings
All options are available in the Micro.blog plug-in settings panel:
- `Photos category` – limit the gallery to a specific category (optional)
- `Allowed photo extensions` – comma-separated list of file types (default `jpg,jpeg,png,gif,webp,avif,heic,heif,tiff,bmp`)
- `Desktop column count` – number of masonry columns above 1200 px (default `4`)
- `Tablet column count` – number of columns between 600 px and 1200 px (default `3`)
- `Mobile column count` – number of columns below 600 px (default `2`)
