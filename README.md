![](icon.png)

**Micro.Masonry Plus** adds a responsive masonry-style gallery to your Micro.blog photos page.  
This fork is maintained by [Ren√© Fischer](https://fischr.org) and is based on [jimmitchell/micro-masonry](https://github.com/jimmitchell/micro-masonry).

## ‚úÖ Features
- Collects **all images** from your posts (front matter, Markdown, and HTML) with an option to keep just the first
- Configurable **allowed file extensions**
- Adjustable **column counts** for desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints
- Optional **layout mode** to choose column-first or row-first arrangement
- Focuses on regular blog posts so bookshelf and static pages stay out of the grid
- Lightweight lazy loading with graceful placeholders and scroll-aware eager loading for the first rows
- Pure CSS/JS solution that respects your existing Micro.blog theme
- Built-in responsive `srcset` generation for local assets and Micro.blog-hosted uploads
